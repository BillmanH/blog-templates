# My own flask-based CMS for publishing jupyter notebooks
This code allows me to work on a jupyter notebook locally on my chromebook and when I'm finished I can take the HTML output and instantly publish it to the web. The code also adds things like GA traking codes, background images, and buttons and links using the Flask template framework. 

It's like being able to use Jupyter Notebooks as my own personal content management system. This greatly speeds up the time-to-deploy by allowing me to publish my scripts as soon as I save them. 

I've still got some things to work on but I like being able to publish a jupyter notebook very quickly. 

## Things I'm still working on: 
* I need to be able to attach a coresponding d3 graphic at the top
* Need metatags and html data
* need to sort by that metadata on my main page
