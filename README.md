# My own flask-based CMS for publishing jupyter notebooks
This code allows me to work on a jupyter notebook locally on my chromebook and when I'm finished I can take the HTML output and instantly publish it to the web. The code also adds things like GA traking codes, background images, and buttons and links using the Flask template framework. 

I've still got some things to work on but I like being able to publish a jupyter notebook very quickly. 

#Things I'm still working on: 
* the jquery isn't hiding the code correctly
* I need a process to include images in the jupyter notebook so that I can upload them as well
* I need to be able to attach a coresponding d3 graphic at the top
